/**
 * The agent-facing tool surface: everything an agent needs to run scheduling
 * end to end, without reaching for raw REST.
 *
 * Grouped below as scheduling, appointments, follow-up, meeting types, booking
 * page, routing forms, CRM, webhooks, calendars. The scheduling loop comes
 * first on purpose — tool order is a weak prior for selection, and the common
 * path should be the first thing a model reads.
 *
 * Two rules hold across all of them, both learned the expensive way:
 *
 *   1. Every request shape is pinned against a route in `apps/api` and covered
 *      by a test that asserts the wire format. 0.1.x shipped five tools that
 *      could never succeed while every test passed, because the tests only
 *      checked that the tools existed.
 *   2. Where the API requires boilerplate the model cannot know (a nested
 *      `attendee`, `receiveReminders`, an empty `confirmationButton`), the tool
 *      fills it in. Making a model invent a large request body from a prose
 *      description is how you get confidently malformed payloads.
