# meetergo MCP server

Lets an AI agent actually run a calendar: find slots, book, reschedule, cancel,
review what is coming up, and keep the contact record straight.

Not to be confused with the **docs** MCP server at
`https://developer.meetergo.com/mcp`, which searches documentation and cannot
change anything. Both are useful and they do different jobs:

| | Docs MCP | This server |
|---|---|---|
| Endpoint | `developer.meetergo.com/mcp` | `mcp.meetergo.com/mcp`, or `npx` over stdio |
| Tools | `SearchMeetergo` | 88 scheduling, CRM, Mira and config tools |
| Can it book? | No | **Yes** |
| Use it to | write an integration | be the integration |

## Setup

Create a Personal Access Token at
[my.meetergo.com/integrations](https://my.meetergo.com/integrations) — it looks
like `rgo-…` — then either point your client at the hosted server or run this
package locally over stdio. The token works on every plan, including Free.

### Hosted

```
https://mcp.meetergo.com/mcp
```

Streamable HTTP, authenticated with `Authorization: Bearer rgo-…`. The path
matters: `mcp.meetergo.com` alone is not the endpoint. For clients that take a
remote URL and headers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "meetergo": {
      "url": "https://mcp.meetergo.com/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer rgo-your_token_here" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Local (npx)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "meetergo": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@meetergo/mcp-server"],
      "env": { "MEETERGO_TOKEN": "rgo-your_token_here" }
    }
  }
}
```

Works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, or anything else that speaks
MCP.

### Scope the token

When you create the token you can limit it to the capabilities the agent
actually needs (scheduling, contacts and deals, Mira, forms, account). A limited
token is refused on everything outside those groups, including reads, so give it
every group whose tools you intend to use — a Mira-only token cannot book, and a
scheduling-only token cannot read your knowledge base.

### Signing in instead of pasting a token

OAuth sign-in is live on the hosted endpoint. Discovery is published at
`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (RFC 9728), so a capable client can
start the flow from the MCP URL. Clients are pre-registered rather than created
through dynamic client registration. For a Claude custom connector, enter the
public client id `mcp-claude` under Advanced settings and leave the client secret
blank. The directory clients for Claude and ChatGPT are configured with their
respective providers.

#### Cursor and Grok Bot

This repository includes the Cursor Marketplace plugin used by both Cursor and
Grok Bot. Install **meetergo** from Settings, Plugins, Marketplace, then finish
the browser sign-in. The plugin connects to the hosted endpoint and uses the
public PKCE client id `mcp-cursor`; there is no client secret or token to paste.

For local review before the marketplace listing is published, load this
repository as a local Cursor plugin. Its `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` manifest
points at `mcp.json`, which contains the same hosted URL and OAuth client id.

A Personal Access Token works in every MCP client, on every plan including Free.
That is what the rest of this page assumes.

### Acting for another user

A Personal Access Token always acts as its owner. To run an agent across a whole
company — an assistant booking on behalf of several colleagues — use a **Platform
API Key** (`ak_live:<uuid>:<secret>`) and name the target user:

```json
"env": {
  "MEETERGO_TOKEN": "ak_live:...",
  "MEETERGO_USER_ID": "the-user-uuid"
}
```

The two token types have opposite requirements, and the server checks both at
startup rather than letting you find out mid-booking:

- a Platform API Key **must** have `MEETERGO_USER_ID` — the API demands an
  acting user on nearly every route;
- a Personal Access Token **must not** — it always acts as its owner, and the
  API rejects the header outright.

Against the hosted endpoint the acting user travels as the
`X-Meetergo-Api-User-Id` request header instead of an environment variable; the
same two rules apply, and sending it with a Personal Access Token is refused.

### Environment

The stdio entry (`meetergo-mcp`, what `npx` runs):

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MEETERGO_TOKEN` | **yes** | `rgo-…` Personal Access Token or `ak_live:…` Platform API Key |
| `MEETERGO_USER_ID` | with a Platform API Key | The user to act as |
| `MEETERGO_API_URL` | | API base override, default `https://api.meetergo.com/v4` |
| `MEETERGO_NEXT_URL` | | Booking-page host rendered into widget install snippets, default `https://cal.meetergo.com` |
| `MEETERGO_TIMEOUT_MS` | | Per-request timeout, default `30000` |

### Running the hosted entry yourself

The package also ships `meetergo-mcp-http`, the Streamable HTTP entry that runs
behind `https://mcp.meetergo.com/mcp`. Credentials arrive per request in the
`Authorization` header rather than from the environment, so one process serves
any number of accounts — `MEETERGO_TOKEN` and `MEETERGO_USER_ID` are not read
here. It reads:

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | | Listen port, default `8080` |
| `MEETERGO_API_URL` | | API base override, default `https://api.meetergo.com/v4` |
| `MEETERGO_NEXT_URL` | | Booking-page host rendered into widget install snippets, default `https://cal.meetergo.com` |
| `MEETERGO_DASHBOARD_URL` | | Dashboard host used for upgrade links in plan-limit errors, default `https://my.meetergo.com` |
| `MCP_PUBLIC_URL` | | This server's public URL, default `http://localhost:$PORT`. Only its **origin** is used: origin + `/mcp` is the resource identifier — the `resource` field of the discovery document, and the value an OAuth token must carry in `aud`. `https://host`, `https://host/` and `https://host/mcp` are therefore the same setting. Anything that is not an absolute http(s) URL fails at startup |
| `OAUTH_ISSUER` | all three or none | OpenID issuer of the authorization server, e.g. `https://login.meetergo.com/realms/meetergo`. Must be absolute and **https** — the exchange posts this server's client secret and the user's token to it — or the process refuses to start. A trailing slash is trimmed |
| `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | all three or none | Confidential client this server exchanges tokens into (RFC 8693) |
| `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | all three or none | That client's secret |

**The three `OAUTH_*` variables are all-or-nothing.** Set all three and an
inbound access token is validated first — issuer, `aud`, `typ: Bearer`, RS256
signature against the issuer's JWKS, expiry — and only then exchanged for a
separate token for the upstream API. The MCP spec forbids forwarding the token a
client handed you, so the exchange is not an optimisation; it is the only path.

Set none and the process is bearer-token-only: Personal Access Tokens and
Platform API Keys work, both `.well-known` paths answer 404, the 401 challenge
carries no `resource_metadata`, and an OAuth token is refused rather than passed
upstream.

Set one or two and you get the bearer-token-only behaviour above, not a partial
OAuth — plus a warning log, `oauth_disabled_incomplete_config`, naming the
variables that are missing.

### Retries

Both entries behave the same here. Rate limits and transient upstream errors
(429, 502, 503, 504) get up to three attempts in total (so two retries),
honouring `Retry-After` where the API sends one.

Retries are **not** applied blindly. A booking or cancellation that fails
ambiguously — a timeout, a dropped connection, a 502 — may already have been
applied by the API, and there is no idempotency key to make a second attempt
safe. Only reads are retried on those; writes are retried solely on a 429, the
one response that states the request was never processed.

## One-prompt onboarding

If your client supports MCP prompts, run **`meetergo: onboard`**. Otherwise
paste this:

> Set up meetergo for my company. Call get_me and get_setup_status first and
> tell me what already exists. Then analyse my website with
> propose_conversion_setup and present the proposed setup — meeting types,
> qualification questions, the website assistant. Build nothing until I approve.
> After I approve: create what's missing, turn the questions into a routing form
> with create_qualification_form, crawl my site, then PROVE it works with
> run_test_drive and show me the verdicts. Finish by giving me the install
> snippet, and verify with verify_widget_install after I've pasted it.

The agent audits what exists, proposes, waits for your yes, builds, and then
**shows you scripted visitors booking through your own assistant** before
anything goes live. A second prompt, **`meetergo: weekly-review`**, pulls last
week's conversations and offers to teach the assistant every answer it missed.

## Plan limits

Every tool reports plan walls structurally: which limit was hit and where
upgrading happens, so your agent explains the situation instead of failing
vaguely. `get_me` also returns a `plan` block (tier, limits) so a good agent
warns you *before* starting something your plan cannot finish. Connecting the
server itself is never gated — a token from any plan, including Free, works.

## Tools

88 tools, covering scheduling end to end. **Scheduling** is the loop most agents
live in; the rest is there so an agent never has to fall back to raw REST.

### Scheduling

| `get_routing_form` | | Steps, fields and routing rules |
| `create_routing_form` | **yes** | Build a qualification form |
| `update_routing_form` | **yes** | Change one |

| `get_contact` | | Full record, by `contactId` or by `attendeeId` from a booking |
| `create_contact` | **yes** | Add a contact |
| `update_contact` | **yes** | Edit a contact |
| `bulk_create_contacts` | **yes** | Import many at once (3 calls per min) |
| `delete_contact` | **destructive** | Remove a contact and its form answers |

### Deals

| Tool | Writes? | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `list_pipelines` | | Pipelines and their stages — read this before creating or moving a deal |
| `list_deals` | | Search and filter by pipeline, stage, contact, company, owner or outcome |
| `get_deal` | | Full record, including linked contact, company, stage and owner |

### Companies

| Tool | Writes? | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `list_companies` | | Search and filter by name, industry, size or owner |
| `get_company` | | Full record, including owner and deal/contact counts |
| `create_company` | **yes** | Add a company. Only `name` is required |
| `update_company` | **yes** | Edit a company; pass `ownerId: null` to unassign it |

| `get_company_by_domain` | | Look up a company by its website domain, e.g. before creating a duplicate |
| `get_company_contacts` | | Contacts linked to a company |
| `get_company_deals` | | Deals linked to a company, across every pipeline |
| `get_company_summary` | | Company counts and pipeline value, grouped by industry and size |

### Communications

| `create_communication` | **yes** | Log a communication on a deal |
| `delete_communication` | **destructive** | Permanently delete a logged communication entry |

### Notes

| Tool | Writes? | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `list_notes` | | Notes logged against a company, deal or contact, most recent first |
| `create_note` | **yes** | Log a note against a company, contact or deal |
| `delete_note` | **destructive** | Permanently delete a logged note |

`list_notes` and `create_note` both require exactly one of `crmCompanyId`,
`dealId` or `contactId` — the API rejects zero or more than one on
`create_note`; `list_notes` checks it itself, since the id picks which nested
path it reads.

### Attachments

| Tool | Writes? | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `list_attachments` | | Attachments on a company, deal or contact (same one-of-three scoping as notes) |

There is no `create_attachment` yet: the API expects a `fileAssetId` from an
upload step whose endpoint hasn't been found. A company-scoped upload route
that looked promising (`POST /crm/companies/{id}/attachments`) turned out to
be a stub — it answers `201` with a plausible-looking body but never actually
saves anything, so it's deliberately not wired up either.

### Tasks

| Tool | Writes? | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `list_tasks` | | Paginated CRM tasks, optionally scoped to a company, deal or contact |
| `get_task` | | One task in full, including its assignee and linked company, deal or contact |
| `create_task` | **yes** | Create a task; `type` and `dueDate` are required, linking to a company/deal/contact is optional |
| `update_task` | **yes** | Change title, type, due date, description or linked company/deal/contact |
| `delete_task` | **destructive** | Permanently delete a task |

Marking a task done isn't offered: `completed`, `status`, `isCompleted` and
`completedAt` all return HTTP 200 but are silently ignored by the API.

### Mira, the website assistant

Everything needed to take a website from "no assistant" to a live one that
answers from the company's own pages and books meetings.

| Tool | Writes? | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `get_setup_status` | | The launch checklist: what exists, what's missing, the next move |
| `get_mira_settings` | | The whole assistant config — read before changing it |
| `update_mira_settings` | **destructive** | Change it; returns the previous settings so you can put them back |
| `restore_mira_settings` | **destructive** | Restore a snapshot taken from an earlier update |
| `propose_conversion_setup` | | Read a crawled site and propose an assistant, qualification and booking setup |
| `create_qualification_form` | **yes** | Turn proposed questions into a real, editable routing form |
| `run_test_drive` | | Scripted visitors talk to the saved assistant; verdicts + transcripts back |
| `get_mira_widget_embed` | | The public key, the embed snippet, and a preview URL |
| `verify_widget_install` | | Fetch a page of the customer's site and confirm it serves THEIR widget |
| `answer_visitor_question` | **yes** | Teach the assistant an answer it was missing |
| `get_conversation_insights` | | What visitors asked and where the assistant had no answer |

### Knowledge base

| Tool | Writes? | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `crawl_company_website` | **yes** | Ingest a website so the assistant can answer from it |
| `get_crawl_status` | | Progress of a running crawl |
| `list_knowledge_documents` | | What has been ingested |
| `delete_knowledge_document` | **destructive** | Remove a document; the assistant stops citing it |
| `search_company_knowledge` | | Retrieve the passages a question would be answered from |

### Webhooks

| Tool | Writes? | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `list_webhooks` | | Endpoints in use (max 6 per company) |
| `create_webhook` | **yes** | Register an HTTPS endpoint |
| `update_webhook` | **yes** | Change URL or events |
| `delete_webhook` | **destructive** | Remove one; events stop immediately |

Writes carry `readOnlyHint: false`, and everything marked **destructive** above
carries `destructiveHint: true`, so hosts can require confirmation before an
agent removes something a human would miss.

## What the tools do for you

The API asks for things a model has no way to know. Rather than describing that
boilerplate in a docstring and hoping, the tools supply it:

- **`book_appointment`** builds the nested `attendee` object, defaults
  `receiveReminders` and the required empty `notes`, and refuses a booking with
  no name rather than writing a blank one into the invitation.
- **`get_availability` and `book_appointment`** resolve which hosts to compute
  for. The API rejects both with `Expected hostIds or queueId` before it even
  loads the meeting type, and a model only ever has a `meetingTypeId`.
- **`create_meeting_type`** fills the six required-but-irrelevant `meetingInfo`
  fields (`customChannelName`, `connectChannelName`, an empty
  `confirmationButton`, …) that reject the whole request when missing. Anything
  the schema does not name goes through `advanced`.
- **`list_appointments`** supplies the required `page` and `pageSize`, which the
  API has no defaults for.

## Development

```bash
npm test          # vitest
npm run build     # tsc -> dist
```

The tests assert the **wire format**, not just the tool list: which path each
tool calls, and the exact body shape the API's DTOs require. That is deliberate.
0.1.x shipped five tools that could never succeed — wrong paths, wrong query
keys, a flat body where `BookingDto` wants a nested `attendee` — and every test
passed, because they only ever checked that the tools existed. Adding or
changing a tool means pinning its request against the route in `apps/api`.
